          Project Overview 
This project leverages machine learning to predict soil fertility status and recommend suitable crops based on soil properties. 
The system provides actionable insights to farmers, agronomists, and stakeholders for improved agricultural productivity and soil health management.
Users can input latitude and longitude or select a region on a map to retrieve soil properties, predict fertility status, and receive crop recommendations. 
A chatbot feature is integrated for additional insights on soil fertility, crop selection, and soil health management practices.
